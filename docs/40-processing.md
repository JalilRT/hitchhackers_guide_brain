# Processing

## Processing infrastructure

Resources currently [here](41-computing.md#Computing-Resources).

## Preprocessing data

Processing has several stages, and can vary depending on which image modality
(or type of data in general) you want to use.

If you are interested in processing a specific type of data, you can refer to
the links below.

## Single-modality Processing

### MRI

Resources currently
[here](42-analysis-software-MRI.md#Neuroimaging-analysis-software-for-MRI)

#### Structural

-   T1w
-   T2w
-   Diffusion MRI
-   Laminar and high-resolution MRI

#### Functional MRI

-   resting state fMRI
-   task-related fMRI

### EEG

### MEG

Resources currently
[here](43-analysis-software-MEEG.md#Neuroimaging-analysis-software-for-MEEG).

## Multi-modal Processing

Some processing pipelines require multiple types of data.

<!-- Pipelines requiring multimodal data can be found [here](). -->
