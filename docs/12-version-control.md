## Data

[Datalad](https://www.datalad.org/for/data-consumers) is to data what git is to
code. It allows curation of data and version controlling of but also lets you
crawl databases to explore and download data from them and it facilitates data
sharing. Several of these features are described
[here](https://www.datalad.org/features.html) with scripts that act as tutorial.
There are videos presentation of it
[there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59CE6iOr45k).
