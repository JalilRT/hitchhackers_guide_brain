# Quality control

When processing data, it is considered good practice (and is also very useful!) 
to inspect the intermediate output files/data created after every few steps. 
Here are some resources that can guide you through this process.

## Introduction

### Introduction about quality assessment process

1. Looking for susceptibility and pathological artifacts

2. Checking whether motion exceeds your lab's thresholds

3. Keeping records to make sure you have the data that you should have.
