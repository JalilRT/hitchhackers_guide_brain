# Quality control

When processing data, it is considered good practice (and is also very useful!) to inspect the intermediate output files/data created after every few steps. Here are some resources that can guide you through this process.

###Let's start with introduction:


##Introduction about quality assessment process
##Quality checks included in this video:


1. Looking for susceptibility and pathological artifacts

2. Checking whether motion exceeds your lab's thresholds

3. Keeping records to make sure you have the data that you should have.

 ### Interesting paper for understanding QA
## It is called Basic quality control routine MRI

###Python libraries for QA
##Different python libraries for QA for different modalities

  
??? example "INCF Tools for quality assessment - This website has a list of QA libraries in python for different modalities with their documentation"
