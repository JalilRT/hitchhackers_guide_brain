# Data repositories

This section contains links to "open" data resources, that can be accessed for research purposes. 
For some of them, a formal request to the organization or to the data curation team may be required.

This [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neuroscience_databases) also has a nice list with some more suggestions.
