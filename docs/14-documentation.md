# Documentation

There are different types of documentation.

Write the docs:

-   website: https://www.writethedocs.org/

-   slackspace:

## Documenting projects and code

It is often said to:

> Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent
> psychopath who knows where you live.

Proper documentation of a project and good commenting of your code will help
others to use it or pick it up later. But there are good selfish reasons to
document your project and comment your code: it will most likely help future you
when you have to respond to reviewers or when you want to check something in
that data set or in that function you used 6 months ago.

> -   Most likely, you will have to re-run your analysis more than once.
>
> -   In the future, you or a collaborator may have to re-visit part of the
>     project.
>
> -   Your most likely collaborator is your future self, and your past self
>     doesnâ€™t answer emails.

### READMEs

[list](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme#tools)

this [checklist](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/readme-checklist) that are more
specific to README files.

In terms of code I guess the ideal is
[self-documenting code](http://wiki.c2.com/?SelfDocumentingCode).

[Read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/) is a good option that also allows for
continuous integration. Python also apparently has this thing called
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) that helps _create intelligent
and beautiful documentation_ (that alone should make matlab users envious).

There are also ways to make it part of a
[continuous integration](https://predictablynoisy.com/circle-documentation-build).
