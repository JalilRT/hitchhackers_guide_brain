# Preregistration

If your work is not purely exploratory you might want to consider
[pre-registering your study](http://help.osf.io/m/registrations). It can be a
good way to decide in advance how you are going to collect and analyze your
data. It helps make it clear to yourself and to others what part of your study
was predicted (i.e confirmatory) and which part wasn't (i.e exploratory).

You can also opt for [registered reports](https://osf.io/8mpji/wiki/home/) where
you submit your methods to a journal and get reviews on the protocol before the
data collection and analysis is conducted. At the moment there is a large number
of [journals that accept registered reports](https://cos.io/rr/#journals).

Pre-registering neuroimaging studies can be quite challenging and comes with a
whole set of constraints that might be absent in other fields.
[Jessica Flannery](https://twitter.com/j_flan) has created a
[preregistration template](https://osf.io/6juft/) based on the OHBM COBIDAS
guidelines for fMRI studies. It is also available
[on Github in an Rmarkdown format](https://github.com/jessicaflannery/fmri-prereg)

For examples of studies that were pre-registered you can search in the
[zotero libraries](https://www.zotero.org/groups/479248/osf/items?) curated by
the [open science framework](https://osf.io/).

There is also a communit effort to keep track of the MRI and MEEG
preregistrtions that exist in this
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_R3UBKvT4vEDOAPXxR8W98QGvZMhpuyxlvYzIGekf0w/edit?usp=sharing)
and new entry can be added using this
[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_l8nTd-gq_WlC7LvpLP5GKChNhD_mok1EnPX48xD3MYzdWA/viewform).

You can find more information in
[this google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p0Tr38HJ2tKAUIoTh-xGPHye3Y6oe8Q-?usp=sharing)
on the effort to develop more templates for pre-reg in neuroimaging.
